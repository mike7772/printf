_printf
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
.B #include
"main.h"

.I
int

.B
_printf
(
.I const 
.I char
.I *
.I format
,
.I ...
);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The printf() functions write output to stdout, the standard output stream; fprintf() write output to the given output stream.

.P
The function write the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

.P
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion speci- fication is introduced by the % character.

.P
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.TP
.B c
.RP
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
.RP
The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL character.
.TP
.B d, i
.RP
The int argument is converted to sign decimal notation.
.TP
.B o, u, x, X, b
.RP
The  unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned binary (b), unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.
.TP
.B p
.RP
The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B r
.RP
The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are reverse written.
.TP
.B R
.RP
The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are Rot13 converted.
.TP
.B S
.RP
The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Unprintable are printed this way "\\x" followed by there ASCII values in hexadecimal (uppercase two characters).
.TP
.B %
.RP
A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

.SH EXAMPLES

.P
#include "main.h"

_printf("%s", "Main");
